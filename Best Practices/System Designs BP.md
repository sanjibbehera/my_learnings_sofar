# System Requirements
Every design starts with requirements, functional and non-functional. And the ultimate goal of design is to meet these requirements. There are so many options when it comes to defining requirements. How to do it right? Let's discuss this in this chapter.

## Functional Requirements


### High Availability

### Fault Tolerance, Resilience, Reliability

### Scalability

### Performance

### Durability

### Consistency

### Maintainability, Security & Cost.

### How does hardware helps
Regions, AZs, data centers, racks, servers
Physical servers, virtual machines, containers, serverless.


### Syncromous vs Asyncronous communication


### Asyncronous messagin patterns


### Network protocols


### Blocking vs non-blocking I/O


### Data encoding formats


### Message acknowledgement


### Push vs Pull (efficient comms in distributed systems)


### Service Discovery, Peer discovery, 


### Network Protocols in real life systems

### Voice over HTTP

### Timeouts, retry mchanism, message delivery gurantees

### Consumer offsets


### Batching and Compressions (msg delivery quickly)


### scale msg consumption, Partitioning strategies, request routing, rebalancing partitions, consistent hashing(deliver data at large scale)


### Rate Limiting, Circuit Breaker, Fail fast design principle, Bulkhead, shuffle sharding
