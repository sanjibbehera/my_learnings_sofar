## What are Protocols?
Protocols are sets of rules and conventions that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. They ensure that devices and applications can communicate effectively and understand each other, despite differences in hardware, software, and architecture. Protocols cover various aspects of network communication, such as data format, timing, sequencing, and error handling.
