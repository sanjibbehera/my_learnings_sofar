## What is ITIL?
ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a widely accepted set of best practices designed to support an organization in gaining optimal value from IT by aligning IT services with business strategy.  
This framework sets the stage by presenting a comprehensive set of best practices for IT service management. It offers organizations a systematic approach to aligning IT services with their overarching business objectives. Covering every facet from incident management to continuous service improvement, ITIL ensures a robust and effective IT service environment.

## What is ITSM?
At its core, ITSM is about action. It takes the guiding principles from ITIL and the agility from DevOps, ensuring IT services are designed,delivered, and managed efficiently. Whether it's handling service requests or overseeing change management, ITSM ensures the lifecycle of IT services aligns with business goals and delivers tangible value. It is also possible a company might be using ITSM but not ITIL, instead.
