## What is GitOps?
**GitOps** is a set of practices that use Git repositories as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. GitOps aims to automate and streamline the process of managing infrastructure and application deployments, leveraging Gitâ€™s version control capabilities to ensure consistency, reliability, and auditability.

## Key Principles of GitOps
- **Declarative Descriptions**: Everything from network configurations to application deployment manifests is stored as code in a Git repository.
- **Version Control**: Git serves as the single source of truth for the desired state of the system. All changes to the system are made through Git commits, providing a clear history of changes, who made them, and why.
- **Automated Deployment**: Changes to the Git repository trigger automated processes that apply those changes to the system. This is typically achieved using continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and tools that monitor the Git repository for changes.
- **Continuous Reconciliation**: The actual state of the system is continuously compared with the desired state defined in the Git repository. Tools automatically correct any divergence, ensuring that the system remains in the desired state.
