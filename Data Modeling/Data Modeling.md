## What is Data Modeling?
Data modeling is the process of discovering, analyzing, and representing data requirements for business operations and software applications. It starts with identifying and scoping data needs, followed by visualizing and precisely communicating these needs through a data model. This model serves as a blueprint, detailing the connections and structures of the organization's data.

## Data Modeling Concepts
- Entities: An Entity represents a category or object an organization collects information about. Entities are the “nouns” of a data model, answering fundamental questions like who, what, when, where, why, or how. For example, a “who” may be a person or organization of interest, a “what” — a product or service, and a “when” — some time interval like a date of purchase, etc.
